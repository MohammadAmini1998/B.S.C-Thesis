## Reinforcement Learning in atari games
This is an implementation for Reinforcement learning in atari games. Both DQN and SARSA has been implemented based on deepMind's paper. For atari gym enviornment, I used Pong which is quite simple enviormnet but it works on any other gym's enviornment as as well.
